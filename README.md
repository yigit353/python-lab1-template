## 🔍 How Autograding Works

Every time you push code to GitHub:
1. GitHub Actions automatically runs your tests
2. Each exercise is graded separately
3. You receive immediate feedback
4. You can push multiple times to improve your score

## 💡 Tips

- **Test frequently**: Run `python test_lab1.py` after completing each exercise
- **Read error messages**: They tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Start simple**: Complete exercises 1-3 first to build confidence
- **Ask for help**: If stuck for more than 5 minutes, ask your TA
- **Check your work**: Make sure your output matches the examples exactly

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

If tests are failing:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check that your function returns the correct data type
3. Verify your calculations with a calculator
4. Make sure you're returning values, not printing them
5. Test with the exact examples given in the docstrings

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Do **NOT** modify `test_lab1.py` or the test files will not work
- Do **NOT** change function names or parameters in `lab1_exercises.py`
- Do **NOT** use `print()` statements inside functions (return values instead)
- Protected files (tests and workflows) cannot be modified

## 🎯 Grading

Your grade is automatically calculated based on passed tests:
- Each exercise has multiple test cases
- Partial credit is awarded for partially correct solutions
- Final score = (Passed Tests / Total Tests) × 100

## Need Help?

- Check the GitHub Actions log for detailed error messages
- Review the function docstrings for requirements
- Ask your TA during lab hours
- Refer to course materials on the LMS

Good luck! 🚀
